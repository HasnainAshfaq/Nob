# NOBSTION was created to raise awareness among the citizens of Pakistan about its various road related problems. Our aim is to eradicate Pakistani roads from ditches, manholes, illegal speed breakers and unlawful roadblocks. 

The purpose of this app/web is to provide citizens an information sharing platform, where anyone who comes across road problems mentioned above can take a picture of the road hindrance and upload it on NOBSTRUCTION. 

Once this is on display for the general public, people can form a group and tackle the issue. Once more and more people consider themselves to be concerned authorities such road obstructions can be resolved privately and this will impose pressure on the government to solve the issue.
